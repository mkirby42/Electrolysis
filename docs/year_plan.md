Personal Growth Plan: 1 Year to a Software Job at SpaceX

Since you already have strong Python, Swift, data science, backend, and iOS experience, along with leadership in a software team, your main areas of focus should be:
    1.    Becoming stronger in C and embedded/real-time systems
    2.    Positioning yourself for the right SpaceX team
    3.    Gaining hands-on experience in relevant projects
    4.    Sharpening interview skills for technical assessments
    5.    Strategic networking & application approach

Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Solidify Fundamentals & Expand Skillset

Technical Skills Growth

✅ Deepen your C skills
    •    Start with systems programming concepts: memory management, pointers, threading, and real-time constraints.
    •    Implement small embedded projects with an ESP32, Raspberry Pi, or Arduino (tie this to your ISRU project).
    •    Read “The Art of Writing Efficient Programs” and “Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) for Embedded Systems”.
    •    Implement simple RTOS tasks using FreeRTOS.

✅ Understand SpaceX-relevant Software Stacks
    •    Learn more about real-time distributed systems (SpaceX heavily uses them).
    •    Read up on high-performance computing, low-latency networking, and message passing (ZeroMQ, MQTT, gRPC).
    •    Experiment with C++ for real-time applications (this will make you much stronger).

✅ Build a CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions
    •    Improve automation for firmware, backend, and iOS deployment.
    •    Learn Jenkins/GitLab CI/CD (common at SpaceX).

Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Apply Knowledge in Personal & Open Source Projects

Projects to Strengthen Your Resume

✅ Upgrade your Martian ISRU Simulation
    •    Rewrite performance-critical sections in C or C++.
    •    Implement real-time sensor data simulation and integrate a hardware component (Arduino, ESP32, etc.).
    •    Use a Docker-based CI/CD pipeline to deploy your simulation.

✅ Contribute to Open Source in Relevant Fields
    •    Look for open-source space, aerospace, or real-time software projects.
    •    Try contributing to PX4 (open-source flight control software) or NASA’s F’ framework.
    •    Document your contributions and publish a blog post.

✅ Improve Your Embedded Systems Knowledge
    •    Study RTOS scheduling, CAN bus, I2C, SPI, UART, and low-latency communication.
    •    Develop a simple sensor fusion project using an IMU (gyroscope + accelerometer).

Phase 3 (Months 7-9): Targeted Networking & Application Prep

✅ Identify the Right SpaceX Teams for You
    •    SpaceX has teams in Avionics, Starlink Software, Ground Systems, Infrastructure, and Flight Software.
    •    Given your experience, Avionics (real-time software), Ground Systems (backend/devops), or Starlink (distributed systems) seem like strong fits.
    •    Research exact job descriptions and align your project work accordingly.

✅ Reach Out to Erin & Other SpaceX Engineers
    •    Let Erin know about your progress and ask if she sees a fit for your skills.
    •    Attend aerospace/embedded meetups and conferences (SmallSat, Hackaday Supercon, etc.).
    •    Connect with SpaceX engineers on LinkedIn and GitHub.

✅ Study for SpaceX Interviews
    •    Coding: Practice C/C++ and Python Leetcode Medium/Hard problems.
    •    Systems Design: Learn real-time systems, embedded design, and distributed computing patterns.
    •    SpaceX-Specific: Study past interviews, focus on low-level debugging, OS internals, and real-time constraints.

Phase 4 (Months 10-12): Applications & Final Push

✅ Tailor Resume & Projects for SpaceX
    •    Showcase real-time projects and system-level contributions.
    •    Highlight performance optimizations, real-time constraints, and software-hardware interactions.

✅ Apply to Multiple SpaceX Teams
    •    Even if you don’t get in immediately, be open to adjacent companies (Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, Relativity Space, Anduril, etc.) as a stepping stone.

✅ Get a Referral
    •    If Erin or another contact can refer you, it will significantly boost your chances.
