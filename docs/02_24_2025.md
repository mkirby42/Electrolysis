## Hands On RTOS with Microcontrollers

### Chapter 1: Introducing real time systems

#### What is real time anyway
A system that has a deterministic response to a real time event
A system considered to fail what it doesn't meet a timing requirement
How fast is real time? ... it depends
O-scope 10sGHz, soldiering iron 50Hz-5Hz, PID for motion control 10s of kHz

#### Types of real time systems
Hardware
Bare metal firmware
RTOS based firmware
- Runs a scheduling kernel on an MCU

RTOS based software
- Full OS with memory management unit and CPU

Defining RTOS
Any OS that provides a deterministic way of executing a give piece of code 
How often not meeting a timing deadline is acceptable and the severity 
Hard firm and soft
Differentiated by the strictness of the failure condition 
Hard must meet the deadline 100% of the time, medical devices and critical control systems
Firm real time systems need to hit deadlines nearly all the time
Soft systems make a best effort
